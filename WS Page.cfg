[h1]Description[/h1]
Ever wondered why you can´t do more with all those beautifull flags?
This mod gives you more options to use the vanilla and your servermod custom flags.

Features:
► Use flags directly as a wrap around your arm or wear them as a cape.
► Attach flags to wooden sticks & cars.
► Craft bandanas, courierbags, improvised backpacks and double armbands from flags.
► Hang up flags on walls or place woodensticks with attached flags. They will be persistent.
► Flags now can visually take damage.
► [b]This mod is inherently fully compatible with all vanilla and all your custom flags.[/b]
